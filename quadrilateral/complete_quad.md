# Properties of Complete Quadrilaterals
Let $\mathcal Q=ABCDEF$ be a complete quadrilateral such that $E=AB\cap CD$, $F=BC\cap DA$, $B$ on segment $AE$ and $D$ on segment $AF$.

## Shared Properties
- The midpoints of three diagonals $AC$, $BD$ and $EF$ are collinear; the line is called the *Newton line*, and will be denoted by $m_\mathcal Q$.
- The orthocenters of four triangles $AED$, $AFB$, $BEC$, $DFC$ are collinear; the line is called the *Gauss-Bodenmiller line*, and will be denoted by $h_\mathcal Q$.
- $h_\mathcal Q\perp m_\mathcal Q$.

## Special Properties

### Foot-Circular Complete Quadrilaterals
If $BEFD$ is circular, call this complete quadrilateral *foot-circular*.

For foot-circular complete quadrilateral $ABCDEF$ with $\Omega=\odot BEFD$:

- The pole of $BD$ w.r.t. $\Omega$ and the pole of $EF$ w.r.t. $\Omega$ both fall on $AC$.

### Incircles
If $ABCD$ has an incircle, we say this complete quadrilateral is *of class 1*.

- **Class 1, Method 1.** For any three points $\{X,Y,Z\}\subset\{A,B,C,D,E,F\}$, if $\triangle XYZ$ is not $\triangle AED$, $\triangle AFB$, $\triangle BEC$ or $\triangle DFC$ (i.e. not a triangle of the original $\mathcal Q$), then
$$\mathcal Q\text{ has an incircle of class 1}\\\iff\\\text{the angle bisector of }\angle X,\angle Y,\angle Z\text{ are concurrent.}$$
