# Welcome!
GeoWiki is a wiki for geometrical properties, especially triangle properties. There are some conventions in this wiki.

## Conventions
Points defined are meant to be *symmetrical*, i.e. If a point is defined for $A$, it should also be defined for $B$ in a same manner. Therefore we write points in the form of $X_A$, meaning the definition of point $X$ with respect to $A$. For example:

> $M_A$ is the midpoint of edge $BC$.

Then we assume $M_B$ is the midpoint of edge $AC$, $M_C$ is the midpoint of edge $BC$. Lines are similar;

> $m_A$ is the median of $A$.

Then $m_B$, $m_C$ are also defined. A list of namings can be found [here](/naming/list).
