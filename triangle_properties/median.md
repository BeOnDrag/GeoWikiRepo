# Properties Involving Medians and Relative Things
This page will contain properties involving $m_A$, $g_A$, $G$, $M_A$ or other relative things.- $K_A$, $D_A$ and $I_A$ are concurrent.
- $D_AK_A$ passes through the point of tangency of $\odot O_A$ and $\odot I$.
- $H_A$, $A'_A$ and $G$ are concurrent.
- $G$ is on the radical axis of $\odot N$ and $\odot AOX_A$, where $X_A$ is the intersection of $GH_A$ and $\odot O$.
- If the projection of $H$ on $m_A$ is $X_A$, then $M_AC^2=M_AX_A\cdot M_AA$.
