# Properties Involving In- and Excenter and Relative Things

This page will contain properties involving $I$, $I_A$, $D_A$, $E_A$, $c_A$, $d_A$, $e_A$ or other relative things.

## Basic Properties
These are basic properties that is directly related to the objects; no (or only some simple) furthur construction is involved.

### $\odot\mathcal J$
- $P$ is the circumcenter of $\triangle\mathcal J$.
- $\odot O$ is the nine-point circle of $\triangle\mathcal J$.
 - $I_A$ is the similitude center of $\odot O$ and $\odot\mathcal J_A$. 
- $e_A$ is the radical axis of $\odot O$ and $\odot\mathcal J_A$.

### $\odot I_A$
- $K_A$, $I_A$ and $D_A$ are collinear; $K_AD_A$, $\odot P$ and $\odot AID_A$ are concurrent.
- If $X_A=M_AI_A\cap h_A$, then $AX_A=\mathbf r_A$.

### Misc.
- $BC$, $e_A$ and $t_A$ are concurrent.
- $D_AK_A$ passes through the point of tangency of $\odot O_A$ and $\odot I$.
- $T_AI\cap AO\in\odot O$; i.e. the intersection of $TA_I$ and $\odot O$ is the antipode of $A$.

## Properties with Furthur Constructions
- Suppose that $AT_A\cap BC=X_A$, then $IX_A$ intersects $\odot O$ at $L_A$ and another point, say $Y_A$; if $Z_A$ is the circumcenter of $\triangle D_AX_AY_A$.
  - Then $D_AT_A\parallel Z_AX_A$.
- Suppose that the reflection of $D_A$ about $c_A$ is $D'_A$.
 - Then $OI$, $BC$ and $AD'_A$ are concurrent.
- Suppose $A^*$ is the reflection of $A$ about $BC$, $D_A^*$ the reflection of $A$ about $I$, and $D_A^{**}$ the reflection of $D_A^*$ about $BC$.
  - Then $\triangle AIO\sim\triangle ID_A^{**}O\sim\triangle D_A^*D_A^{**}I\sim\triangle AA^*I_A$.
- If $\odot AE_AM_A$ intersects $AB$ and $AC$ at $X_B$, $X_C$ resp.
  - Then $BX_B=CX_C$.
